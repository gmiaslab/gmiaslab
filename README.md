- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gmiaslab
- ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in:
    - Precision Medicine: Personalized Approach
         - Our personalized medicine investigations extend the concepts of precision medicine to the individual, assessing multiple omics during longitudinal profiling.
    - Multi-Omics Integration
        - Omics analyses and integration requires extensive processing. MathIOmica and PyIOmica provide a user-friendly framework for handling downstream analysis and visualization.
    - Scientific Community Resources
        - Creating models necessitates robust omics datasets, particularly for time series analyses and network inference. We are creating multiple such sets available to the community.
